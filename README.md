## Purpose:
The purpose of this web app is to help a visitor find a recipe. based on criteria.

## Summary
Our web app allows a visitor to search for recipes based on ingredients, cuisine type, or dietary restrictions. S/he will get a paginated list, but has the option to navigate to a full scroll result page that shows a snippet of the recipe (image, title). When the visitor clicks on a specific recipe, the page will reroute to full details. There is an about page with the developers who worked on the web app.

## Notes
Our team used HTML, CSS / SASS, and REACT with POSTGRES as a database and Github repository for storing all our files.
